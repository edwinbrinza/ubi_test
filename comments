Part 1:
-for the size of the table: show tblproperties schematransaction (and get the value of the property rawDataSize)
-using HDFS and clusters with many distributed nodes, where data is replicated (by default the replication factor=3). In case of a failure, data can be taken from one of the replicas


Part 2:
-RDDs (contain java objects and use Garbage Collection and serialization, which are expensive when data grows)
